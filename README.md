The proponents of this project replicated the functionality of X, the former Twitter page/application. Although no login elements were utilized, the project focused on the feed function as well as the settings. The final output was a feed application where users could create, like, 'retweet,' and bookmark posts. It featured both hardcoded and newly created messages, along with several media formats.  
  
Below are some of the features of the page:  
  
1. All pages comprise a navigation tab placed on the left side of the page, the main feed or profile tab in the middle, and a side box on the right.  
2. The Navigation tab contains the following buttons: Home, Profile, Bookmarks, and Settings. It is worth mentioning that these are all functional buttons, with all links created by the proponents. Additionally, a cool feature included in the project is the Dark and Light modes, allowing users to toggle the button and switch the background from dark to light (and vice versa). This setting will remain consistent across all pages unless toggled again.  
3. The side box consists of the search tab, some featured YouTube videos, and the legal information.  
4. The Main Feed is where the big chuck of the project focused on, which heavily rely on the use of JavaScript to display different elements such as the profile photo, user details, various media files, and different interactive buttons such as the comment, retweet, like, bookmark and forward/send. Users will be able to view the changes they made even if the page was reopened.  
4.1. The profile photo and name, once clicked, will bring the user to the profile page of the author of the tweet.  
4.2. The comment button will allow the user to add comment (text) just below the main tweet, and all elements under it will be adjusted accordingly.  
4.3. Hit retweet and like and they will change the button display output and increase the counters. Hit agian and it will go back to default display and counter.  
4.4. The bookmark button will let the user to add tweets to the bookmarks page.  
5. The profile page of each twitter user features some information such as their handle, description, some account statistics, display photo and cover photo, as well as a post feed at the bottom. Users can also toggle between Posts and Followers tab.  
6. The Settings page has the delete and mode options.  
  
The proponents incorporated insights gained from the first part of the Winter Semester, as well as information available on the internet. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
  
1. Figma from the UI/UX Design course, which helped the proponents design the project's flow.  
2. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS coding.  
3. DOM Manipulation.  
4. Proper use of Semantic tags in HTML.  
  
As a result, the well-commented finished project uploaded on GitHub satisfies the required criteria for Sprint 1.  
  
Finally, the proponents would like to acknowledge some sources such as Font Awesome, YouTube (videos), Unsplash (photos), and ChatGPT (text contents and suggestions).  
  
Thank you.
